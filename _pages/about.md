 I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR/IST), LARSyS, Instituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon. I am particularly interested in the field of artificial intelligence applied to the development of fully autonomous robots. My current research focuses on the development of high-level planning methods to tackle multi-robot problems under uncertainty. I've been addressing problems that have inherently long term horizons. Several applications can benefit from these methods, such as multi-robot surveillance, patrolling, monitoring and inspection, as well as many industrial scenarios like mining, construction and warehouse automation.
