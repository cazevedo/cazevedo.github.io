 I am a researcher at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt), and a PhD Student at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon under the supervision of Professor [Pedro Lima](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~pal/index.html). I am particularly interested in the field of artificial intelligence applied to the development of fully autonomous robots. My current research focuses on the development of high-level planning and learning methods to tackle multi-robot coordination problems under uncertainty. I've been addressing problems that have inherently long term horizons such as multi-robot continuous surveillance, patrolling, monitoring and inspection.

 Since 2017 that I have been contributing to the [SocRob](https://irsgroup.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/socrob/) project as part of the [SocRob@Home](https://irsgroup.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/projects/socrob-home/) team. The focus of the project is to address challenging robotic problems through the participation in scientific competitions. Currently the team is commited to service robots in domestic, healthcare and office environments. I have participated in the [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org) 2018 and in the [ERL SciRoc](https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/index.html) Smart Cities 2019 among other minor competitions.
